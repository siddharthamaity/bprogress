import { TypeTable } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/type-table';

One of the great new features of **BProgress** version `1.1` is the ability to integrate one or more progress bars anywhere in your code.

The `Progress` component is optional, meaning you can use it to create one or more progress bars in your code. If you don't, the default progress bar will be created automatically.

<Callout type="warn" title="Warning">
  When using a custom component for the progress bar, the component will not be dynamically added or removed from the DOM. Instead, it will simply toggle between `display: block` and `display: none`.  
  This behavior may impact performance, especially if the component involves complex rendering or layout calculations.
</Callout>

## Progress

### Import

You can import the `Progress` component like this:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Progress } from '@bprogress/...';
</script>
```

<Callout title="Note">
  Replace the `...` in the import with the library you're using. For example, if you use `@bprogress/nuxt`, import by doing `from '@bprogress/nuxt'`
</Callout>

<Callout type='warn' title="Warning">
  The `Progress` component must be used inside the `ProgressProvider` with the option `template` set to `null`.

  ```vue
  <template>
    <ProgressProvider :options="{ template: null }">
      <Progress />
    </ProgressProvider>
  </template>
  ```
</Callout>

### Usage

You can use one or more progressive components anywhere in your code.

<Callout type='warn' title="Warning">
  The `Progress` component has a `display:none;` style by default, and this will change to `display:block;` for display. You won't be able to play with the component's display property. 
</Callout>

You can use with no children:

```vue
<Progress />
```

This will automatically create a complete progress element like this:

```vue
<template>
  <Progress>
    <Bar>
      <Peg />
    </Bar>
    <Spinner>
      <SpinnerIcon />
    </Spinner>
  </Progress>
</template>
```

You can also use any children you wish like this:

```vue
<template>
  <Progress>
    <Bar />
  </Progress>
</template>
```

This can be a good solution if you want to customize your `Progress` component with TailwindCSS classes like this:

```vue
<template>
  <div class="fixed top-4 overflow-hidden inset-x-4 rounded-lg bg-neutral-100 h-10">
    <Progress>
      <Bar class="!absolute z-[9999] !bottom-0 !top-auto" />
      <Spinner class="!top-16">
        <SpinnerIcon />
      </Spinner>
    </Progress>
  </div>
</template>
```

<Callout title="Note">
  Here we use `!` to set classes to `!important`, as we're using basic CSS. However, if you're using custom CSS or no CSS with the `disableStyle` property, you don't need to set the classes to `!important`. 
</Callout>

### Props

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| is | `string \| Component` | `'div'` | The component or HTML element to render. This prop uses Vue's is attribute for dynamic rendering. |
| class | `ClassValue` | `undefinded` | The class of the progress element |
| style | `string \| CSSProperties` | `{ display: 'none' }` | Custom styles. The component always adds `display: none;` to the provided styles before applying them to the root element. |
| ...rest | `HTMLAttributes` | - | All additional props are forwarded to the rendered element. |

## Advanced Usage

To create absolute position progress bars inside elements that are not directly aligned with the screen edges, you'll need to set the `positionUsing` option to `width`.

```vue
<template>
  <ProgressProvider :options="{ template: null, positionUsing: 'width' }">
    <Progress />
  </ProgressProvider>
</template>
```

<Callout title="Note">
  By default, `positionUsing` will give priority to `translate3d` (depending on browser compatibility), as this method leverages GPU acceleration, providing smoother animations and better performance, especially for complex or frequently updated UI elements. Using `translate3d` helps reduce layout recalculations and enhances rendering efficiency compared to other positioning methods.
