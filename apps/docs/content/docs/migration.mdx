title: Migration from NProgress-V2
description: Migrate from NProgress-V2 to BProgress
---

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

To **clarify the library’s identity** and enable it to **evolve more freely**, we decided to move away from the name **NProgress-V2** and adopt a new identity: **BProgress**. This rebranding gives us the opportunity to **start fresh on a solid foundation, introduce new features, and provide more integration libraries** while fostering a richer ecosystem around the project.

There are some differences with the `nprogress-v2` package. 

## Migration to BProgress `1.1`

The first difference is the name of the `nprogress-v2` package, which is now called `@bprogress/core`. So you can change the import like this:

```diff title=JavaScript
- import { NProgress } from 'nprogress-v2';
+ import { BProgress } from '@bprogress/core';
```

The second difference is that all occurrences of “nprogress” have been replaced by “bprogress” in the code.

So you can change your code like this for example:

```diff title=JavaScript
- NProgress.start();
+ BProgress.start();
```

CSS has also changed, so if you're using custom CSS, be sure to rename all your `.nprogress` to `.bprogress`.

```diff title=CSS
- .nprogress
+ .bprogress
```

## Migration to BProgress `1.2`

The difference is about the `template`, `barSelector` and `spinnerSelector` options. We no longer use roles as selectors, as the “bar” and “spinner” roles are not valid ARIA roles.

So you can change your code like this (only if you use these options):

```diff title=JavaScript
- NProgress.configure({
-   template: `<div class="bar" role="bar"><div class="peg"></div></div><div class="spinner" role="spinner"><div class="spinner-icon"></div></div>`,
-   barSelector: '[role="bar"]',
-   spinnerSelector: '[role="spinner"]',
- });
+ BProgress.configure({
+   template: '<div class="bar"><div class="peg"></div></div><div class="spinner"><div class="spinner-icon"></div></div><div class="indeterminate"><div class="inc"></div><div class="dec"></div></div>',
+   barSelector: '.bar',
+   spinnerSelector: '.spinner',
+ });
```

And then you can use the `BProgress` object as you would use the `NProgress` object.

<Callout type="warn" title="Warning">
  The `nprogress-v2` package remains available and can still be used in its current version. However, it will no longer receive updates or maintenance in the future. While migrating to `@bprogress/core` is not mandatory, we recommend doing so to benefit from ongoing improvements and new features.
